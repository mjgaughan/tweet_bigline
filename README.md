# tweet_bigline

This is a project to record the effects/correlation of tech CEOs'/executives' twitter behavior on their companies' stock prices. Inspired by a Twitter thread by [@mcclure111](https://twitter.com/mcclure111).

# muskrat_0.py
This is the first file in the project, at the moment it listens for a tweet from a given user or pertaining to a given subject, once there is a new tweet, the program most of the code in this file pertains to monitoring and grabbing tweets. 

# process_financials_0.py
Most of the code in this file pertains to API calls for BTC and stock prices when called upon. This file also contains the Tweepy code to quote tweet a given tweet with the updated information found. 

This project is still in the beginning stages. The goal is to build this out into an ML model that can predict changes in stock prices from the time of a given tweet.
