# muskrat_0.py
This is the first file in the project, at the moment it listens for a tweet from a given user or pertaining to a given subject, once there is a new tweet, the program 
fetches stock data on a given ticker and also Bitcoin at the current price. 

This project is still in the beginning stages. The goal is to build this out into an ML model that can predict stock prices from the time of a given tweet.
